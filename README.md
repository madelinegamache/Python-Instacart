# Python-Instacart
Analysis for Instacart sales department as part of the CareerFoundry Data Analytics program.
## Objective
Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. Your task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria. The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products.
## Key Questions
The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.

They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.

Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
## Data
Open source data from Instacart and a fabricated customer data set created for the purpose of this project.
